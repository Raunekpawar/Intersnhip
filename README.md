Title of Project:-Hand Written Digit Prediction
Objective:- The objective of my Hand Written Digit Prediction project is to develop and implement a robust machine learning model that can accurately recognize and classify handwritten digits. This internship project aims to leverage state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and datasets like MNIST to train a neural network capable of recognizing numeric characters with a high degree of accuracy. By successfully achieving this objective, I aim to improve the field of computer vision and contribute to applications such as digit recognition in forms, automated data entry, and enhancing the accuracy of handwritten digit recognition systems in various domains.
